#SEO Best Practices
##What is the reason for search engine optimization?
Google accounts for about 65% of search market. 93% of visits to any site originate with a search. 75% of users do not go beyond the first page of search results. If the majority of visitors of any website start with a search, use google, and do not go beyond the first page of results, it's a website owners prerogative to make certain that their site is as optimized for those conditions as possible.

##Style-agnostic Tags

Start with semantic, meaningful HTML to ensure content is organized in a logical and hierarchical manner. This takes planning, communication, and improvisation. Use style-agnostic tags and typographic classes to apply visual hierarchy; that is, do not rely on simply styling a tag without a class or id attached to it. This doesn't mean you can't have a basic style for tags, but it means that you should have override classes that can immediately change the appearance without having negative cascading effects.

```
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  /* browser resets go here */
}
h1 {
  font-weight: 500;
}
/* don't stop there^ */
.h1 {
  font-weight: 900;
}
.h2 {
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

##Basic Guidelines
###Meta Fields
Ensure there is a method to populate unique title and meta fields for any page. When `<meta/>` tags are the same across multiple pages, crawlers interpret this as duplicate content.

###Redirects
Ensure redirects for sub-directories without trailing slashes; that is, if a url does not end in a trailing slash (**/path**), a server-side redirect when possible should redirect the visitor to the same path with a trailing slash (**/path/**). This is because both paths could be treated as duplicate content without the redirect.

###Heading Tags
There are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines. Be flexible.

- One H1 per [sectioning content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-html5-20101019/content-models.html#sectioning-content) (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`).
- Do not skip the next size in heading; i.e. do not place an `<h3>` if there is no preceding `<h2>`.
- Do not put lower heading tags above a higher heading tag.
- Home pages should implement a hidden H1 with the clientâ€™s brand name or site title. This is not the logo. Additionally, for scenarios with flexible content where the user may reorder blocks of content, ensure that there is a definitive `<h1>` on pages where this is not defined.

### Lists and Links
- Use unordered lists for collections.
- Links always need text, even if exclusively used with a styled user interface content.

###Image Lazy/Deferred Loading
Images can implement lazy load or deferred load as well as background images provided an img tag is available.
